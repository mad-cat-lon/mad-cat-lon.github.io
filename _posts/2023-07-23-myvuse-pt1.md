  <h1> Reverse engineering the Vuse vape ecosystem (pt 1) </h1>
  </section>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>British American Tobacco (BAT) is a company famous for trying to sell cigarettes to literally anyone, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65393223">North Korea</a>, <(https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65393223), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/28/british-american-tobacco-apologises-for-advertising-e-cigarette-in-kids-app">children</a>, and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/british-american-tobacco-fights-dirty-in-west-africa">jihadists in Mali</a>. Unfortunately, despite BAT's diverse portfolio of target markets, cigarettes have been on the decline for several decades, whereas vaping has become increasingly common. In order to enter this highly competitve market, BAT has been successfully selling disposable pod-system vapes under a subsidiary named Vuse, formerly known as Vype. The low price, long battery life and high build quality with brushed metal shells makes Vuse vapes a popular choice with many people (including myself).</p>
  <p>
  BAT has recently included BLE capabilities into their products, claiming that the improved security of Vuse vapes makes them an effective solution to the underage vaping epidemic. Through the MyVuse companion app that connects to the vape, users can perform role-based access control (lol), set recharge reminders, track usage and location, and adjust the resistance of their coil. In this series of writeups, I will document and explain the process I took to reverse engineer the target device's hardware, firmware and companion app. I have very little experience with reversing/exploiting Android applications, nor do I know much about BLE, so if you find some mistakes let me know!

  <h2>BLE overview</h2>
  <h3>What is BLE></h3>
  <p>
  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also known as Bluetooth Smart, is a power-efficient variant of the classic Bluetooth technology, designed for short-range communication between devices. Developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), BLE is popular in applications that require infrequent short bursts of data transmission, prioritizing low power consumption over high data transfer rates.
