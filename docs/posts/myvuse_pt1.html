        Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also known as Bluetooth Smart, is a power-efficient variant of the classic Bluetooth technology, designed for short-range communication between devices. Developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), BLE is popular in applications that require infrequent short bursts of data transmission, prioritizing low power consumption over high data transfer rates.
